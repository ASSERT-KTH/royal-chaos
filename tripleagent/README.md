# TripleAgent

TripleAgent is a system for fault injection in production for Java applications. The unique feature of this system is to combine automated monitoring, automated perturbation injection, and automated resilience improvement. The latter is achieved with ideas coming from the failure-oblivious literature. We design and implement the system as agents for the Java virtual machine.
